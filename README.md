### Hey y'all 👋🏻

I'm Xander, I'm an astronomer at the Institute of Astronomy in Cambridge, UK.

🔭 I’m currently working on using machine learning techniques to study white dwarf stars *️⃣

⏪ In the past I've worked on exochemistry, and used contrastive learning to find two quasars called Sam and Seb ★★
