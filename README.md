### Hey y'all 👋🏻

I'm Xander, I'm an astronomer at the Institute of Astronomy in Cambridge, UK.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on using machine learning techniques to study white dwarf stars ✳️

- ⏪ In the past I've worked on exochemistry, and I once found two high-redshift quasars called Sam and Seb ★★
